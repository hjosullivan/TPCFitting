Thermal model fitting library.

Based on code written by Joss Thomas for his "Hotter is Better" project.

All code written in Python 3

Check thermal models README for list of dependencies

Thermal_Models.py: Main fitting library, See README_THERMAL_MODELS

01_fit_from_database.py: Fit schoolfield-sharp models to datasets from database and plot them:
	- takes data in biotraits format from Data/database.csv
	- outputs graphs of fits to Results/fits
	- outputs fitted parameters results file to Results/summary.csv

To run, navigate to Code directory, then:

	> Python3 01_fit_from_database.py


===============================================================================================================

Bugs/TODos:

* Currently `estimate_uncertainty` isn't compatible with the Boltzmann-Arrhenius model because 
it does not have a "model" attribute. This means `fit_from_database.py` only works with the difefrent Schoolfield models 
at the moment.
