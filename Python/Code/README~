####### PYTHON #######

Thermal model fitting library based on code written by Joss Thomas for ''Hotter is Better'' project
Note that this is Python3!

Check thermal models README for list of dependencies

Authors: thomas.smith1@imperial.ac.uk; tjt213@ic.ac.uk

Thermal_Models.py: Main fitting library, See README_THERMAL_MODELS

01_fit_from_database.py: Fit schoolfield-sharp models to datasets from database and plot them:
	- takes data in biotraits format from Data/database.csv
	- outputs graphs of fits to Results/fits
	- outputs fitted parameters results file to Results/summary.csv

To run, navigate to Code directory, then:

	> Python3 01_fit_from_database.py


===============================================================================================================

Bugs:

currently estimate_uncertainty isn't compatible with boltzmann arrhenius due to it not having a "model" attribute...
... meaning fit_from_database.py only works with Schoolfield models at the moment ...
... this is fixable, but I just haven't done it yet.



###### R ######

Also added the Schoolfield fitting code in R:

Code/SchoolfieldModelling.R

Simply for fitting Schoolfield to data and ignoring all the other stuff that the python code was written for...
