# R scripts to fit TPC curves

All these scripts do the similar things, and need to be combined into a single package. 

In addition, the `TestingCodes` subfolder contains old versions or testing versions of fitting code :

 - `DimitrisBernardoFittingCode.R`: A combination of Dimitris & Bernardo TPC's fitting codes.
 - `FittingCode.R`: Richard's code for TPC fitting base don samraat's original R code.
 - `PreAcclimAnalysis.R`: Sofia's code for preliminar analysis on acclimation data.
 - `response_functions.R`: Bernardo's code for TPC fitting.
 - `SchoolArrhenFitStartWithStartValEst_LowTemp.R`: TPC fitting code including low temperature inactivation (Sofia).
 - `SelfStartTest.R`: Sofia's code for testing the self-starting values for the Schoolfield model.
 - `TestTRef.R`: Sofia's code for testing TRef.
 - `TPCFitting_NonRandomSV.R`: TPCFitting code without random starting values.
 - `TPCFitting_NMLE.R`: Test of TPCFitting code using nmle.
 - `Combplots without schLow.R`: Adam Khwaja's script for his summer project.
